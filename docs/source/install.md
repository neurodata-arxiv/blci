# Installation

BLCI install is quick and simple. There are only a few dependencies:

Your system must have working version of:
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Pip](#TODO)

**NOTE:** You may need to run the commands listed here with
higher user privilege such as root i.e., prefix commands with `sudo`.




BrainLab-CI can be installed by cloning the github repo as follows:
- Through SSH: `git clone git@github.com:neurodata/blci.git`
- Through HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/neurodata/blci.git`

Once the repo is cloned simply `cd` into the BLCI directory and use the
`console.py` script to perform desired actions.

```
cd blci
./console.py -h
```

**TODO:** Under construction
