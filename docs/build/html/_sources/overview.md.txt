# Overview

BrainLab-CI (BLCI) is a code and data management contiuous integration tool that
; providing the ability to perform collaborative, community experiments with
data-quality controls and full provenance. BLCI autonomously determines code
dependencies and provides infrastructure to link code to data items.


## Functionality
BLCI provides the ability method to:

- Create a dependency-aware pipeline (or section of a pipeline) that tracks
code and data dependencies and performs autonomous updates when upstream
changes occur.
- **TODO:** Trigger provenance
- **TODO:** Verification
- **TODO:** Visualization
